This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About

This is a test project to see how to integrate dhtmlx/[dhx v6](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/?_ga=2.64631851.583185686.1564135333-1970732696.1552768871) with React

I did my best trying to implement [Layout](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/suite/samples/layout/) but due lack of code samples and support stopped here.

# Install

- clone repo
- `yarn` installs dependencies
- `yarn start` runs the app
